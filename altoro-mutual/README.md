# 🧪 Altoro Mutual – Manual Testing Project

This project is part of my broader [Manual Software Testing Portfolio](https://github.com/mariansopoliga/manual-software-testing-portfolio).  
It simulates a real-world QA process using the demo banking site [Altoro Mutual](https://demo.testfire.net), focusing on test case design, execution, and defect handling.

## 🚧 Project Status: Work in Progress

This is a real manual testing project in development. It already includes:

- Structured test suites in TestRail
- 44 executed test cases across multiple areas
- CSV exports of test runs
- Screenshots of passed/failed test executions

### 🔜 Coming Soon:
- Bug report markdowns linked to failed test cases
- Jira issue references in CSV exports
- Full execution of the “Fund Transfer” test suite
- Summary charts and diagrams
