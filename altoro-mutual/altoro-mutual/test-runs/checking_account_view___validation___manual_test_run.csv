Transactions across all three sections (Recent, Credits, Debits) were inspected.
The """"10 Most Recent Transactions"""" table contained only unique rows.
In the """"Credits"""" section, six rows displayed identical values across Account, Date, Description, and Amount.
The """"Debits"""" section also contained multiple transactions with identical visible fields.
Due to the lack of timestamps or transaction IDs, it is not possible to determine if these are valid duplicates or data anomalies.
Test marked as passed based on visible field comparison.
Recommendation: UI should display unique transaction identifiers or timestamps to support proper uniqueness validation.
