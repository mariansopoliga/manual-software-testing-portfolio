# Manual Testing Portfolio â€“ MariÃ¡n Sopoliga

Welcome to my manual QA testing portfolio. This repository documents my practical experience with **manual software testing**, including real test case creation, execution results, and bug reporting using industry-standard tools like **TestRail** and **Jira**.

Each folder in this repository represents a separate test project or module. All tests were performed on public test environments and are intended to demonstrate my hands-on skills in structured test design and defect documentation.
