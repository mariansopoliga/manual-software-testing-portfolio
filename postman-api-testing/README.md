## ðŸ§ª Test Cases Overview

| TC ID | Method | Endpoint           | Test Type        | Description                                |
|-------|--------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| TC01  | GET    | /posts/1           | Positive Test    | Valid post retrieval by ID                 |
| TC02  | GET    | /posts/9999        | Negative Test    | Invalid post ID returns empty/404          |
| TC03  | POST   | /posts             | Positive Test    | Create new post with valid data            |
| TC04  | GET    | /posts             | List Test        | Retrieve list of all posts (100+)          |
| TC05  | POST   | /posts             | Negative Test    | Missing required field: `title`            |

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

All responses were verified and saved inside `/postman-request-screenshots` for each test case.  
They include request method, URL, status code, and response body.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

### Understanding `"userId"` Field:
In test cases TC03 and TC05, we use a field like `"userId": 99` or `"userId": 42`. This represents which user is creating the post. In a real system, this would link the post to a valid authenticated user. In this mock API, it's a placeholder that accepts any numeric value.

### Why `"userId": 42` in Negative Test (TC05)?
To isolate the test to **missing title only**, not an invalid user. We kept `userId` valid so the response failure (or success) relates purely to the missing `"title"` field â€” this ensures proper test isolation and clarity.

### Fake API Behavior:
JSONPlaceholder accepts even incomplete or invalid input (e.g. TC05 returns `201 Created` despite the missing title). This taught me that mock APIs donâ€™t always enforce validation â€” and why real testing environments are critical.

## ðŸ“˜ Notes
This project is designed to simulate real-world API testing scenarios using manual steps only. No automation tools were used to keep it aligned with beginner QA expectations.
